# CredibilityCheckCrawler
Python and Javascript based Crawler 

## Caution 
- This readme is not reviewed by someone and I typed it asap despite I'm not good at english

## these files is used for my master thesis

## ** I forgot functions in this crawer  **
- So if you happen to any problems, I cannot help and support you. 
- Pls use these scripts at your own risk.

## this crawer needs some meta files
- It needs files for judging credibility of webpage, deciding webpages to visit, avoiding to visit well-known webpages( ex. sns, google search result etc. ) and webpages reported that ”Don't access my pages” from administrator in past projects.
- So if you want to crawl and judge webpages preciously pls update meta file. Applying new meta files and rules are greatly appreiated
- Some files and directories is uploaded. But all of them is compressed. In addition, even if you un-zip them, Some files is empty. For ex, *.pre.   
	- So you should read master function to put meta files in right way:D
